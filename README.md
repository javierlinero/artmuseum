## About The Project!
Imagine walking into the vast Princeton University Art Museum,
surrounded by thousands of mesmerizing artworks, but feeling overwhelmed
about where to start. Enter our innovative app, built on the swift
Flutter framework, designed to revolutionize your art discovery
experience. Picture this: every day, you're introduced to a new piece of
art tailored just for you, thanks to our unique "Tinder for Art" feature
that learns your preferences. Want to explore more? Dive into our
browsable gallery at your fingertips. And for those who love a blend of
art and adventure, we've incorporated a fun scavenger hunt game using a
map, guiding you to art pieces scattered around the campus. With our
app, art isn't just viewed; it's experienced. Let's make art discovery
at Princeton not just a visit, but a personalized journey.
